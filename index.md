**Manoa Study Abroad Central Your Guide to the World**<br>
Our project is crafting a user-friendly website that serves as a central hub for UH Manoa's diverse study abroad and exchange offerings. This digital platform is designed to break down the details and provide clear comparions of the Manoa International Exchange (MIX), Study Abroad Center, and National Student Exchange programs. Through our site, students can access testimonials from peers who've participated in these programs, gaining insight into the advantages and challenges each one presents. Additionally, our platform presents detailed information on various destinations and schools, featuring firsthand accounts from the student community. Our website's interactive features make it easy to browse through posts about different countries, helping students map out their study abroad adventures.

## Strategy
Our project follows the Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) guidelines. We will be holding our meetings twice a week, specifically on Mondays and Thursdays from 5-6 PM via discord. We will be breaking our work into 72-hour tasks, each one logged as a GitHub issue. Every team member will take on two tasks, ensuring shared responsibility and progress. To track our development, we will establish milestones every 7-14 days.
