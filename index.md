## Overview
Manoa Study Abroad Central is a digital platform dedicated to simplifying the process of choosing a study abroad or exchange program at UH Manoa. It will be a user-friendly website designed to help students understand the various programs available to them, including the Manoa International Exchange (MIX), Study Abroad Center, and National Student Exchange (NSE). Since these programs offer different types of experiences, it can be hard for students to determine which study abroad program is best for their wants and needs. This site aims to clarify program details and provide clear comparisons to assist students in making informed decisions about their international educational experiences. It will also include testimonials from peers who have previously participated in these programs, offering valuable insights into the benefits and potential challenges of each option.<br>

## Strategy
Our project follows the Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) guidelines. We will be holding our meetings twice a week, specifically on Mondays and Thursdays from 5-6 PM via discord. We will be breaking our work into 72-hour tasks, each one logged as a GitHub issue. Every team member will take on two tasks, ensuring shared responsibility and progress. To track our development, we will establish milestones every 7-14 days.
